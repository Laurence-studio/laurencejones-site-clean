<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The initial request was to create a pixel-perfect clone of . This was later pivoted to build a personal portfolio site for an artist named Laurence Jones.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS included:
- **Site Re-branding:** Update hero text, navigation, and footers to reflect Laurence Jones.
- **Page Implementation:**
    - Create , , , , , and  pages.
    - Implement a  page with provided content.
    -  & : Implement gallery layouts with filtering and detailed artwork views. The  page should have a sales focus, a dark theme, and a unique entry screen.
    - : Implement a two-column layout with a sticky timeline.
    - : Implement a vertical, stacked layout.
- **Specific UI/UX Features:**
    - Create a dark-themed  page with a unique typographic landing/entry screen.
    - Add a Share module (Email, WhatsApp, Copy Link) to artwork detail pages.
    - Add an Exhibited history dropdown to the  detail page.
    - Fix navigation and state bugs related to scrolling and filter resets.
- **Latest Request:** Systematically replace all placeholder images across the site with user-provided assets. The user is providing images page by page, and the agent is currently populating the  page.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A highly customized full-stack portfolio website for Laurence Jones. The frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS, fetching dynamic content from a FastAPI and MongoDB backend. The site features a homepage, a comprehensive Featured Works gallery (14 works), a dark-themed Vault gallery (in progress), Viewing Rooms with custom layouts, and pages for Studio, Exhibitions, and a CV.

A key architectural decision was made to segregate artwork data into three distinct MongoDB collections ( for the homepage, , and ), each with its own schema and API endpoints to support different image requirements for each section.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: Adding the 5th of 7 total artworks to the  page. The user uploaded the three required images (main, wall, interior) for this artwork. The agent saved the files but has not yet created the corresponding database entry or verified the update.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: Complete the addition of the 5th vault artwork (P0)

Issues Detail:
- Issue 1:
    - Attempted fixes: The agent has saved the three image files uploaded by the user to the  directory.
    - Next debug checklist:
        - Create a new entry in the  MongoDB collection using the data from the recently uploaded files.
        - Take a screenshot of the  page to confirm the new artwork appears in the gallery grid.
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: To continue the user-directed task of populating the Vault page.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Is recurring issue? N
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: Frontend
    - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
- Task 1: Complete populating the Vault page (P0)

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1:
     - Where to resume: After verifying the 5th artwork is added, wait for the user to upload the images for the final 2 vault works.
     - What will be achieved with this?: The  page will be fully populated with all 7 artworks as requested by the user.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: Frontend
     - Blocked on something: User to provide images for the remaining 2 artworks.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **(P1)** Populate placeholders on  detail pages: The user needs to provide 4 images for Californication House and 2 for Maybourne.
  - **(P1)** Replace placeholder portrait on the  page.
  - **(P1)** Update the biography text on the homepage, which still references Jeff Koons. The user needs to provide the correct text.
- **Future Tasks:**
  - **(P2)** Replace placeholder images on the  page.
  - **(P2)** Replace all placeholder text (e.g., exhibition history) with final copy from the user.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, React Router (), Tailwind CSS, , .
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (using  async driver).
- **Data Modeling**: Separated artwork data into three distinct collections (, , ) to handle varied image requirements per page.
- **Dynamic Content Management**: Added multiple new API endpoints to  to create and update artworks and biography information on the fly, moving away from a static seed script.
- **Image Handling**: A workflow is established where the user uploads images directly in the chat, the agent saves them to , and then updates the database with the file paths.

**key DB schema**
- **artworks**:  (Used for Homepage)
- **biography**: 
- **featured_works**: 
- **vault_works**: 

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
- ****: Heavily modified. Contains all new API endpoints for , , and for updating  and .
- ****: Rewritten to use the  hook and display three distinct images on the detail page.
- ****: Rewritten to use the  hook, separate gallery/detail images, and an Exhibited dropdown.
- ****: New hook for fetching data for the Featured Works page.
- ****: New hook for fetching data for the Vault page.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file is becoming a monolith, handling all API logic for multiple data models. It would be beneficial to refactor the routes into separate files using FastAPI's  for better maintainability (e.g., , ).

**key api endpoints**
-  (GET),  (PUT)
-  (PUT)
-  (GET, POST),  (PUT)
-  (GET, POST)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Data Segregation is Key:** The project has three separate collections for artworks (, , ). You must use the correct API endpoints and data models for each page to avoid data mismatches.
- **Iterative Content Workflow:** The established process is: User uploads assets -> Agent creates/updates database record -> Agent verifies with a screenshot -> User approves. Continue this loop.
- **Pay Attention to Image Types:** The user specifies different image roles (e.g., , , ). Ensure you are mapping the uploaded images to the correct fields in the database.
- The user has stated there are a total of 7 works for the Vault. 4 are complete, 1 is in progress, and 2 are pending user upload.

**documents and test reports created in this job**

    -  page: Portrait placeholder is present.
    -  page: All content is placeholder.

N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent was in the middle of processing the user's request to add the 5th vault work. It saved the uploaded image files but was interrupted before creating the database entry and verifying the result. The immediate next step is to complete this action.</analysis>
