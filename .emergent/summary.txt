<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The initial request was to create a pixel-perfect clone of . This pivoted to building a bespoke, high-end personal portfolio website for an artist named Laurence Jones.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
- **Site Re-branding:** Update all branding, text, and navigation to be centered around Laurence Jones.
- **Page Implementation:** Create and populate , , , , , and  pages.
- **Content Population:** Systematically replace all placeholder images and text across the entire site with user-provided assets for every page.
- **Bug Fixes & Polishing:** Address UI/UX issues as they arise, such as scroll behavior, image loading states, and visual artifacts.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A comprehensive, full-stack portfolio website for Laurence Jones. The frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS, fetching some dynamic content from a FastAPI and MongoDB backend. The site features a homepage, a Featured Works gallery, a complete Vault gallery, Viewing Rooms, and pages for Studio, Exhibitions, and CV. All placeholder content, including biography text and all images, has been replaced with final assets provided by the user. The project is now in a polishing and bug-fixing phase.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The user reported a jumping and flickering scroll issue on the homepage, which prevented smooth scrolling past the main image gallery. An initial fix attempt failed. The agent is now in the middle of a second attempt, re-implementing the fade-out text effect using the  API for better performance. The implementation is partially complete but has not been tested.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: Homepage scroll is jumpy/flickering at the bottom of the hero gallery. (P0)

Issues Detail:
- Issue 1:
    - Attempted fixes:
        1. Optimized the existing  event handler with  and debouncing. This did not solve the issue.
        2. Removed the animation and made the text static. This was rejected by the user who wanted the original fade-out effect.
        3. Currently implementing a new fix using an  via a custom  hook to control the animation.
    - Next debug checklist:
        - Complete the implementation in  to correctly use the new  hook and a sentinel element.
        - Test by scrolling down the homepage.
        - Verify that the scroll behavior is smooth, without any jumping or flickering.
        - Confirm that the LAURENCE JONES fixed text fades out smoothly as it approaches the biography section.
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: To resolve a critical UX bug that makes the homepage difficult to navigate and feels unprofessional.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Is recurring issue? Y
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: Frontend
    - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
- Task 1: Complete the implementation of the  fix for the homepage scroll issue.
    - Where to resume: . The  hook has been created, and the  component has been partially modified. The logic to tie the observer's state to the text's opacity needs to be finalized and tested.
    - What will be achieved with this?: A smooth scrolling homepage with the desired fade-out text animation.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: Frontend
    - Blocked on something: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Future Tasks:**
    - **(P2) Refactor Backend:** Refactor  into separate route files using FastAPI's  for better maintainability (e.g., ).
    - **(P2) Refactor Frontend Data:** Move the large, hardcoded  object from  into a separate data file (e.g., ) to improve component readability.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Recently completed:**
  - **Homepage Biography:** (DONE) Updated the main biography with final user-provided copy, switching from a database-driven approach to hardcoded content for simplicity.
  - **Studio Page Content:** (DONE) Replaced all text on the Studio page with a new biography, exhibition list, and milestones.
  - **Vault Page Content:** (DONE) Updated copy, changing Exhibited to Exhibition History, added detailed exhibition histories, and conditionally showed Private Collection for sold works.
  - **Featured Works Content:** (DONE) Implemented a detailed status (Private Collection / Available via Studio) and exhibition history section for all works. Also swapped the thumbnail images for two works as requested.
  - **Viewing Rooms Content:** (DONE) Updated all text copy for both the landing and detail pages, and changed a date.
  - **Image Loading & Performance:** (DONE) Addressed a recurring black square bug by replacing large JPEGs with smaller WebP files, and changing the loading placeholder from black to a neutral color with a shimmer animation.
  - **Navigation & Scroll Bugs:** (DONE) Fixed multiple navigation issues where pages wouldn't reset state or scroll to the top when navigating via the header.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- The black square image loading issue on the Californication House page is a high-risk recurring issue. While it was addressed by switching to smaller WebP images, the user has reported it multiple times after previous fixes. The root cause (slow loading of large images) has been mitigated but not eliminated. The next agent should be prepared for it to potentially reappear.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, React Router (), Tailwind CSS, .
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (using  async driver).
- **Performance Optimization**: The agent has shifted from using expensive  event listeners to the more performant  API for scroll-triggered animations. It also addressed image performance by replacing file formats (JPEG -> WebP) and improving loading states.
- **State Management**: Complex client-side state is managed within React components using hooks (, , ), particularly for handling navigation, detail views, and conditional content.

**key DB schema**
- **artworks**: 
- **featured_works**: 
- **vault_works**: 
- **biography**:  (This is now unused for the homepage, which has hardcoded text).

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
- ****: **Currently being modified.** File for the in-progress homepage scroll fix.
- ****: **Newly created** to implement the  logic.
- ****: Heavily modified to add a large hardcoded metadata object and render detailed artwork status and history.
- ****: Heavily modified with updated copy and conditional logic for artwork status.
- ****: Heavily modified to fix navigation bugs, update all text content, and replace gallery images.
- ****: Modified to replace all text content.
- ****: Modified to use hardcoded biography text instead of fetching from the API.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-  could be split into multiple router files for better organization.
-  contains a very large hardcoded data object that should be moved to a separate file to improve component clarity.

-  (GET)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Priority #1:** Finish and test the  implementation in  to fix the homepage scrolling bug. This is the main blocker.
- **Content is King (and Hardcoded):** Be aware that most of the site's detailed text content (biographies, exhibition histories, viewing room descriptions) is now hardcoded directly into the JSX components, not stored in the database. When a user asks for a text change, you will likely need to edit a  file.
- **High-Recurrence Bug:** The black square image loading issue on the Californication House page has been reported multiple times. Although fixes were implemented (including using smaller WebP images), it may still occur. If the user reports it again, further investigation into image optimization or loading strategies may be needed.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
None.
