  shortBio: "Jeff Koons is one of the most prominent artists working today. He is known for challenging the limitations of fabrication while transforming everyday images and objects into works of art that engage the viewer in a dialogue with the time in which we live and our historical past. For four decades, Koons has created works that explore themes of self-acceptance and transcendence.",
  birthInfo: "Jeff Koons was born in York, Pennsylvania in 1955. He studied at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, Maryland, and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois. He received a BFA from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 1976. Koons lives and works in New York City.",
  exhibitions: "Since his first solo exhibition in 1980, Koons's work has been shown in galleries, museums, and cultural institutions throughout the world. Koons's work is in numerous collections, including The Broad Art Foundation, Los Angeles, California; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Tate Gallery, London; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.",
  recentExhibitions: "His work was the subject of a major exhibition organized by the Whitney Museum of American Art, Jeff Koons: A Retrospective (June 27 - October 19, 2014), which then traveled to the Centre Pompidou Paris and the Guggenheim Bilbao. Recent solo exhibitions include Shine at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence and Jeff Koons: Lost in America at Qatar Museums in Doha. Porcelain Series is currently on view at Gagosian, 541 West 24th Street, in New York City.",
  famousWorks: "Koons is widely known for his bold paintings and sculptures, including Rabbit, Michael Jackson and Bubbles, Puppy, and Balloon Dog. The smooth, mirror-finished surfaces of his iconic stainless steel sculptures reflect and affirm viewers and their environments. A dialogue with the readymade is evident in his complex paintings that often employ bright, saturated color, communicating the artist's interest in art history, the biological, and acceptance. Koons earned renown for his public works, such as the monumental floral sculptures Puppy and Split-Rocker.",
  awards: "Jeff Koons has received numerous awards and honors in recognition of his cultural achievements. Notably, President Jacques Chirac promoted Koons from Chevalier to Officier de l'Ordre National de la Légion d'Honneur for his ongoing strengthening of relations between France and the United States; and in 2013 Koons was honored with the U.S. Department of State's Medal of the Arts for his outstanding commitment to the Art in Embassies Program and international cultural exchange."
